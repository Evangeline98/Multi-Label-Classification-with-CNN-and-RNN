# Multi-Label-Classification-with-CNN-and-RNN
This repo is our research for multi-label classification for artworks in iMet. Here we implemented and modifed 9 various neural networks, including attention, baseline, cbam, rethink, modifed rethink, seresnext1/2/3/4.

The data comes from research competition on Kaggle, which is a multi-label classifictaion problem for artwork in iMet. And finally we reached F2 score at 0.63.

The significant contribution of our research is the comparison between the different networks with CNN and RNN and innovative ideas of Bi-stage Rethinking network with semantic similarity of labels, which largely improves the accuracy for such problems.
